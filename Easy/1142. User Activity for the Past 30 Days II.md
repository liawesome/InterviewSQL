### Thought

- In a peroid of 30: date_sub(), datediff() < 30 as we going to include '2019-07-27'
- Use avg() to find the number of session per user 
- group by after filter condition

### Answer 

```
with cte as (select user_id, count(distinct session_id) as sessions from Activity
where activity_date between date_sub(‘2019-07-27’, interval 29 days) and ‘2019-07-27’
group by user_id )

select round(avg(sessions),2)  as average_session from cte 


```
