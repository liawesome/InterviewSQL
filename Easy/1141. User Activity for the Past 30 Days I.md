### Thoughts

- The question asks about the DAU count for a peroid of 30 days.
- For time range, use **date_sub**(date, interval 29 days).


### Answer 
```
select activity_date as day, count(distinct user_id) as active_users from activity 
where activity_date between date_sub('2019-07-27', interval 29 day) and '2019-07-27'
group by activity_date

```
