### Thoughts:
- Distinguish with post_id and comment_id.
- Use self-join to have a table with post_id and relative comments as sub_id.  

### Answer: 

```
with cte as (select distinct(s1.sub_id) as post_id, s2.sub_id from Submissions s1
left join Submissions s2
on s1.sub_id = s2.parent_id
where s1.parent_id is Null ) 

select post_id, count( sub_id) from cte
group by 1
order by 1 
```
