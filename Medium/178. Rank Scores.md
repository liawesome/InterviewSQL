### Thoughts:
- The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
- If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. ( use dense_rank ) 
- After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.

### Answers: 
select score, dense_rank() over (order by score desc) as "rank" from Scores
