### Thoughts: 

- Aggregate the games played consecutively based on the dates given and player_id. ( group by ) 
- Window function: Sum() over()
- Organizing it into sections/partitions/windows by product.
Within each section/window, we arrange/order the data by transaction_date, and we're adding up spending as we go down the section.


### Answers: 

```
select player_id, event_date, sum(games_played) over (partition by player_id, 
  order by event_date) as games_played_so_far
