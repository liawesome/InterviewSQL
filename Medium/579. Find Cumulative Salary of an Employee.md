### Thoughts:

- The question aks to get the cumulative sum of an employee's salary over a period of 3 months but exclude the most recent month
- rolling window problem. 
- period of 3 months can be expressed as : 
  - range 2 preceding 
  - range between 2 preceding and current row
  (- range between interval '1' day preceding and current row) For cases use days


### Answers:
```
with cte as (
select id, month,
  sum(Salary) over (partition by id order by Month range 2 preceding) as Salary, 
  rank() over (partition by id order by Month DESC as rnk  -- exclude the most recent one
from Employee )

select id, month, Salary from cte 
where rnk > 1 
order by 1, 2 DESC

```
