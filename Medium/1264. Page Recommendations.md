### Thoughts
- Union for finding the correct user_id + Join for finding the page_id + Subquery for filtering page_id when user_id = 1 

### Answer 
```
with user_info as (select user2_id as user_id from Friendship
where user1_id = 1 
union 
select user1_id as user_id from Friendship f2
where user2_id = 1 ) 

select distinct(page_id) as recommend_page from user_info 
left join Likes 
using( user_id )
#filter 
where page_id not in (select page_id from Likes where user_id =1) 

```
